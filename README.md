# FinancialDetective

Financial Detective is a tool designed to help you gain a comprehensive understanding of your financial transactions from multiple banks. It requires manual download of CSV files from supported banks, parses the data, and loads it into a SQL database. This allows you to analyze your income and expenses, identify trends, and develop strategies to manage your finances more effectively.


Key Features

- Manual Data Collection: Financial Detective currently requires manual download of CSV files from supported banks. (If you have a free alternative to automate this process for example web scraping or API calls, please let us know.)
- Financial Detective performs an accurate balance analysis to only consider actual expenses and income. To do this, transactions between imported banks are identified and excluded from the analysis. This ensures a more accurate and insightful analysis of your finances.
- Financial Detective can automatically assign transactions to specific categories(once they are set up). This makes it easier for you to analyze your finances and identify trends and patterns.
- Financial Detective can generate a report that shows your expenses for each category over time or all categories of a specific month. This report can help you identify where you can save money.

    
The repository is fully customisable with new banks and categories and freely available to everyone for private use.
